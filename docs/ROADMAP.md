# Pocket DSH / Native Harness — current state and next work

Updated 2026-09-08 after packaging the native workspace in [PR #1](https://github.com/Awis13/PocketDSH/pull/1). Code baseline for this assessment: `70b9a5f` (with core `a40a5c2` and vendor `10610a3`).

This is a source-based reconciliation of the earlier DSH and Warp research, not another live walkthrough of either product. It supersedes implementation-status claims in the older research notes. Recommended work below is a plan, not approved implementation. Do not infer a completion percentage from the number of broad feature rows.

Subsequent increment, 2026-09-08: **NH-CONTEXT C1–C5 are implemented** — frozen provider requests, usage normalization, optional llama.cpp count/props, configured limits, estimated fallback, a shared Shell/Chat context indicator and retained request diagnostics. C1–C2 were pushed to `codex/native-context-compaction`; C3–C5 add durable model-only projections, bounded compaction and manual controls as local increments. [Request accounting and diagnostics](NATIVE-CONTEXT.md) records configuration and verification. C4 covers summary generation, validation, cancellation, operation receipts and automatic pressure handling. C5 adds shared `/compact`/button/status/Stop, reconnect receipts and developer CLI controls. The isolated Home Rig smoke verified the installed count/props path; physical iPad validation remains.

## Product contract

One native workspace, one session journal, two parallel presentations: touch-friendly Chat and keyboard-first Shell. Shell Enter executes/sends terminal input; Command+Enter asks the integrated agent in place. Switching presentation keeps the session, draft, output and agent history. Output and agent steps stay visible in Shell. Themes, split panes, active-pane Command+W and local/private-network inference remain core requirements.

There are **two backends**. A feature in the existing DSH client is not automatically implemented in the Swift engine. iOS runs the client; the macOS host owns processes, tools and model requests. SwiftTerm and Nerd Fonts are bundled; eza is an optional native host executable. Node/Python are not native runtime requirements, but remain development or optional DSH-plugin tools.

## What is already implemented

| Area | Current implementation and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Native execution | Swift 6 provider/SSE adapter, separate text/reasoning, indexed tool calls, bounded steps, cancellation, SQLite events, writer lock, durable request receipts; `NativeHarness/Sources/HarnessCore` |
| Tools and permissions | Workspace list/read/exact edit, finite shell command, one-use allow/reject, fail-closed behavior; read-only terminal inspect/read/wait. No agent PTY writing or OS sandbox |
| Native host and client | Authenticated loopback WebSocket host; one shared Shell/Chat presentation journal; live tool output and stop/approval status; `NativeHost.swift`, `NativeChatConnection.swift`, `PocketStore.swift` |
| Real terminal | Persistent zsh and POSIX PTY, command hooks, cwd/exit status, live SwiftTerm surface, Ctrl+C/focus routing; live Mac htop round trips recorded |
| Blocks and input | Open output, select/previous/next, Find, copy command/output/both, immutable context attachments; basic host Tab completion, Up/Down history, local fish-style suggestions |
| Rendering | Theme-aware ANSI palette/style retention, symbols in live/replayed output, optional eza helpers; exact retained Unicode width/copy fidelity still needs broader fixtures |
| Workspace and recovery | Existing splits and pane close, saved layout/ratios/session/drafts, replay after disconnect/restart. A dead process is not resurrected; unknown/interrupted outcomes are explicit |
| Existing DSH backend | Models, basic queue/current-draft steering, approvals/questions, images, voice relay, Markdown/diff sheet and themes remain available through DSH |

Verification refreshed for this checkpoint: 65 Swift core/host tests, offline protocol/Markdown/transcript/editor checks, 11 mocked voice tests, five real-process probe suites, and unsigned Mac Catalyst + generic iOS builds passed. XcodeGen reproduces the project and bundles font/notices. The observation probe was repaired to expect normalized model excerpts while still requiring a complete later output line. Earlier live Mac evidence is in [integration notes](NATIVE-CHAT-INTEGRATION.md). No fresh physical iPad test or installation was performed. GitHub CI status is reported separately on the PR.

## DeepSeek Harness mechanics: what remains

These are the ten boundaries from [the source research](NATIVE-HARNESS-RESEARCH.md), compared with the current Swift implementation.

| Mechanic | State | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One execution owner | Implemented in core | Conversation and compaction share ownership; manual maintenance refuses BUSY and Stop preserves pending work |
| Queue vs steering | Core implemented; client partial | Host prompts enqueue; CLI exposes queue/steer/remove/resume. The native wire/UI lacks delivery mode and queue item controls. Add pending-state projection and stable-ID edit/remove/steer operations |
| History vs model context | Implemented in core | Versioned model projection plus retained source/UI journals, token budgets and request provenance; retention/paging remains separate |
| Provisional streaming | Implemented foundation | Keep partial versus completed identity; future retries need attempt reconciliation. UI currently discards some unfamiliar event kinds |
| Parallel tools | Missing | Engine executes sequentially. Add bounded concurrency, exclusive barriers and deterministic commits without hiding live per-tool progress |
| Permission policy | Partial | One-use approvals exist. General access profiles, scoped persistent grants, client policy selection and actual OS enforcement do not |
| Crash recovery | Implemented foundation | No automatic command replay; preserve unknown outcomes. Retention quotas, paging, disk-full/power-loss tests and large-history measurements remain |
| Balanced compaction | Implemented; physical iPad pending | Bounded summary requests, balanced groups, protected recent/current turns, validated smaller request and atomic versioned commit/receipts; ID-based app/host/CLI controls and recovery |
| Goals and children | Missing | No native goal/plan/subagent/workflow drivers. Define lineage, authority, concurrency and cancellation before adding their UI |
| Reconnect reconciliation | Implemented foundation | Ordered replay, acknowledged prompt IDs and saved drafts exist. Add version/capability negotiation, explicit unknown-event handling, paged replay and multi-client policy |

Provider-specific gaps: one configured compatible endpoint/model per host, no automatic provider retry policy or per-session model/effort selection. C1–C2 account for usage/request budgets and the output reserve, display them in both views, and retain request metadata across replay/restart. Diagnostics report observed milestones; they do not split provider queue time from prefill or establish cache hits. The [benchmark](HARNESS-BENCHMARK-2026-09-08.md) used unequal tool/context/cache conditions and is not a pure Swift-versus-TypeScript speed comparison.

## DSH client inventory reconciliation

All 46 original IDs are retained below. The original audit described the **DSH adapter**, not the later native host. Existing source was checked; new backend success paths were not exercised for this documentation pass.

| Original IDs | Current DSH client gap | Native-host implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G01, G21 | Only local /view, /model, /new; no server command/skill catalog | Need capability-backed command registry and skills, not arbitrary slash text sent as a prompt |
| G02, G03, G42, G43 | Effort/preset selection and provider/preset administration absent | Model catalog, per-session configuration and preset mechanism also absent in core/host; model selection UI is disabled |
| G04, G05 | Full access exists from an approval; no general/default access selector | Native allows one-use decisions only; policy changes need a host contract |
| G06, G07, G18 | Plans/goals and specialized activity states absent | No native drivers; generic running/approval status is not plan or goal support |
| G08, G09 | Basic queue and current-draft steering exist; no item editing/removal or busy-send preference | Basic prompt enqueue works, but no visible pending native queue or steer controls; preserve Shell Enter semantics |
| G40 | Screen use on a phone: implemented. The composer and the bottom panel fold on the reader's scroll, an explicit reading surface hides them entirely, empty blocks are no longer drawn, and the keyboard can be kept off a task that just opened | The shell presentation keeps its own panel and never folds. Fold state is per pane; no cross-device preference sync |
| G10, G11, G12, G13, G14 | Rename/fork/turn-branch/archive and content search remain absent; search filters loaded titles | Native host lists/opens saved sessions but lacks these management operations |
| G15, G16 | Existing workspace choice/filter; no metadata management, grouping/manual order | Native session creation uses the host workspace; no workspace catalog/management |
| G17 | Subagents filtered out; no lineage navigation | Native child-agent execution and identity are also missing |
| G19, G20 | No remote @file/@folder/@session picker | Native terminal-block attachments are implemented; they do not cover file/session references |
| G22, G23, G24, G26 | Shared context meter, request/usage inspector and compaction controls implemented; injection inspector remains | C1–C5 implement accounting, durable diagnostics, bounded compaction and manual controls |
| G25, G27, G28 | No trajectory or persistent tool side inspector; Markdown/diff/tool rendering partial | Better terminal styles do not implement native file/diff contracts or request inspection |
| G29, G30 | No completed-turn grouping or durable turn navigator | Native block navigation is present, but does not navigate agent turns. Any process compaction must stay optional in Shell |
| G31 | Retry/token-limit/unknown-event coverage incomplete | Native context-limit error is now explicit; retries and general compatibility fallback remain missing |
| G32, G33 | Whole-message copy/feedback incomplete | Shell command/output copy is implemented; it is not a general chat feedback/copy surface |
| G34, G35, G36, G37 | Images only; generic files/artifacts, external open and session export absent | Native image/voice input is not wired; general artifacts and share/export need native transport |
| G38, G39, G40 | No jobs/schedules/workflow panels | No corresponding native persistent drivers/catalogs |
| G41 | Basic DSH questions exist; advanced navigation/plan-specific answers absent | Native tool catalog has approvals but no general ask-user/plan-review tool |
| G44, G45 | No plugin inventory/configuration or host configuration entry point | No native plugin lifecycle/config schema; administration is later scope |
| G46 | English-only interface is intentional for now | Localization is optional, not a release blocker |

## Warp interaction inventory reconciliation

All 55 research IDs are mapped. “Partial” means the useful core exists, not that all documented Warp behavior has been reproduced. Warp's installed-app walkthrough was not completed; original evidence consists of pinned source, official documentation and reference media.

| Original IDs | State in the integrated Pocket path | Remaining work / scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W01, W02, W03 | Partial: individual blocks, keyboard navigation, copy and Find implemented | Range selection, bookmarks, broader search and large-output limits |
| W04, W05, W06 | Missing dedicated UI | Output filters, sticky command headers, explicit unassigned/background-output blocks; never invent process provenance from mixed PTY bytes |
| W07 | Partial: local copy | Export later; public permalinks optional |
| W08, W49, W50 | Partial: themes, fonts, ANSI palette, theme JSON import/export and local settings | Independent density/cursor controls and complete settings portability; whole-window transparent Liquid Glass remains deferred |
| W09, W10 | Partial: interactive PTY surface and selection | Full-pane TUI presentation, explicit return anchor, rectangular/multi-block selection and keyboard-protocol coverage. Current inline TUI height is capped |
| W11 | Partial: native multiline editor and standard editing | Broader IME/Unicode/wrapped-line and physical iPad keyboard validation |
| W12, W13, W14, W17 | Missing | Editor Vim keymap, alias expansion preview, syntax/argument inspector and visible command correction are optional later features; executing Vim in PTY already works |
| W15, W16 | Partial: basic Tab, session history and history ghost implemented | Fuzzy/all-session history, command-specific flags/Git completions and optional model suggestions |
| W18 | Missing; optional | Explicit multi-target synchronized input, not default behavior |
| W19, W52 | Missing | Local parameterized saved commands/workflows/prompt library before any sharing service |
| W20, W29 | Partial: local slash commands | One action registry/palette; native compaction has real host controls; fork and model commands still need host operations |
| W21, W22 | Implemented product contract | Explicit Shell/Chat views and in-place agent submission; no auto-detection requested |
| W23 | Implemented bounded slice | Immutable selected-block attachments with preview/remove; retain explicit size/retention limits |
| W24 | Partial: block context | File/session/URL and multimodal context need native schemas |
| W25, W26 | Read-only observation implemented; control missing | Model-visible screen/lifecycle state, input ownership, approved writes, revocation, stale-write rejection and handback |
| W27, W28 | Partial: one-use approvals and core inbox | Profiles/policy and queue UI; no implication that a button alone grants agent PTY writing |
| W30, W31 | Missing in native host | General user questions, structured plans/tasks and review lifecycle; DSH has basic questions |
| W32, W38 | Missing in native engine | Instructions/skills discovery, MCP and explicit memory policy; Seed stays backlog |
| W33 | Partial: direct private provider connection | Native model/effort/catalog selection and provider capabilities |
| W34, W35 | Missing in native backend | DSH voice/images already work separately; reliable notification delivery remains unresolved |
| W36, W37 | Missing dedicated integration | Foreign CLI agents, indexing, browser/computer use and search are separate capability projects; a raw shell can still run installed programs |
| W39, W40, W41 | Partial: sidebar, split tree, resize and active-pane close | Directional focus/maximize in the actual app path; tab reorder/reopen/pins/groups and drag/drop. The earlier NativeWorkspace experiment has been deleted |
| W42, W43 | Partial: saved current layout, sessions and drafts, replay/recovery | Named layout templates, paged history and multi-device policies; no dead-process resurrection |
| W44 | Missing; optional | Global summon shortcut and customizable toolbar |
| W45 | Partial: raw SSH can run inside PTY | Shell hooks/completion do not automatically install inside SSH or subshells; integrated remote-shell support needs a separate contract |
| W46, W47, W48 | Missing native workspace review/editor/worktree management | Start with read-only diff beside the current pane and hunk context; a full editor/LSP is later scope |
| W51 | Partial: cwd, Markdown and some native accessibility | Clickable file/link actions, bell policies, quit warnings and focused daily-use/accessibility checks |
| W53, W54, W55 | Deferred | Team collaboration, cloud orchestration and factories are outside the immediate local-first MVP |

## Recommended next milestones

The broader comparison changes the priority from adding another input feature to making long native sessions dependable. These are bounded proposals; nothing here starts a development cycle.

1. **NH-CONTEXT — visible context pressure.** C1 provider accounting and C2 shared context/request diagnostics are implemented, including explicit unknowns, durable metrics, bounded protocol notes and preservation of unknown envelope/request fields. Acceptance uses a verified/configured capacity and distinguishes exact counting from estimates; an arbitrary provider with unknown capacity cannot guarantee advance warning. Users can inspect the failed request stage. Never fabricate cache hits or prefill percentages.
2. **NH-COMPACT — bounded model context.** C3 implements separate durable projections, migration, version checks, atomic replacement and complete tool boundaries. C4 adds summary generation/validation, protected recent/current turns, cancellation, receipts and automatic pressure handling. C5 provides commands/buttons, status/Stop and integrated controls; isolated host/restart and Home Rig smoke passed. Acceptance: continue a deliberately over-budget conversation without losing the original UI history or replaying tool effects; failed/cancelled summaries leave the old projection intact. Follow with bounded provider retries and request-attempt reconciliation.
3. **NH-DAILY — control the native session.** Expose core queue/steering/pending cancellation first; then model/effort and explicit access mode, rename/archive/fork and content search. Split delivery controls from session management into separate changes. Acceptance: edit pending work while output streams, handle already-consumed IDs, and reopen the same session with truthful settings.
4. **NH-TERMINAL — complete focus and monitoring.** First full-pane TUI/return, directional pane focus/maximize and real iPad keyboard/touch validation; then model-visible command/screen state. Agent input/takeover is a separate guarded host milestone (NH-CONTROL), with human input revoking permission and stale writes rejected.
5. **NH-REVIEW — inspect changes beside work.** Read-only workspace/branch diff, changed-files list, hunk attachments and artifact open/share. Acceptance: inspect the correct file/base and ask about a selected hunk while preserving the current session, draft and scroll position.
6. **NH-EXTENSIONS — reusable agent capabilities.** Versioned instructions/Markdown skill discovery, typed tool/permission API, then MCP or Seed adapters. General questions/plans and child-session lifecycles remain distinct engine work; do not promise all DSH plugins by loading Markdown alone.

**Optional small slice: NH-AI-SUGGEST.** Explicit shortcut/button for a bounded local-model command suggestion, cancellation when the draft changes, visible origin and accept/edit/reject. Never auto-execute. Ordinary Tab/history stays immediate while inference is busy. Continuous background prediction is a separate opt-in decision after latency measurements, not the default next priority.

**Reliability alongside these stages:** journal retention/paged replay, large-history render measurements, foreground/background output attribution, Unicode width/copy fixtures, one-client-per-session policy, host service/tunnel packaging and physical iPad reconnect/focus checks. Track these as concrete limits; do not mark the 30-scenario research checklist passed because the current 65 unit tests pass.

**Deferred product scope:** full IDE/LSP, cloud/teams/factories, forced language localization, dependable Apple push delivery, transparent whole-window glass and Seed deployment. The user's Seed concept remains recorded in the private backlog and has no installed native adapter yet.

## Evidence boundaries

- This checkpoint reran offline tests and isolated process probes, and built both Apple targets. Earlier live Mac checks are explicitly dated in the integration notes; no new UI redesign was tested here.
- DSH UI inspection happened against 0.1.3-alpha.2. The Warp public-source snapshot is pinned in its study. No new upstream-version compatibility claim is made.
- Native generic iOS compilation does not establish physical-device interaction, background behavior or secure remote setup.
- Known constraints: host binds loopback; eight instantiated shells per launch; one attached client per session; native command rendering retains bounded previews; full journal replay/history currently grows without quotas/paging; the PTY is not a security sandbox.
- Builds pass with warnings. The Swift 5-mode client reports a main-actor conformance warning for `NativeTerminalDelegate`/`TerminalViewDelegate`; audit that boundary before enabling Swift 6 language mode. The vendored library also has upstream deprecation/style warnings. No new linter or independent code review was run for this checkpoint.
- **Backlog TODO:** `scripts/check.sh` type-checks only selected shared files and never compiles `PocketDSH/PocketStore.swift` / `QueueDockView.swift`, so an app-target-only type error can leave CI green; a Catalyst app type-check is deferred because it requires the vendored SwiftTerm module built for Mac Catalyst, which is too heavy/flaky for the current check path.
- The research inventories remain useful historical evidence. This document and the integration contract are the current implementation-status entry points.
